//TODO: 
/*
Need to add a goal in some fashion, so that each NPC has some goals they are trying to accomplish

Need to add Haidt's moral values to allow a NPC to determine what is good/bad

Need to add some sort of personality integration/wisdom field that contols how much NPCs can deviate from their personality to achieve their goals. 
	Perhaps a maturity level? 

Potentially need to add dark triad traits? Perhaps these would be linked to maturity, where maturity mitigates dark triad tendancies?
